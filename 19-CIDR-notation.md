# 📏 CIDR Notation (/24, /16) in Networking

---

## 🧠 What Is CIDR?

**CIDR** stands for **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**. It’s a smarter, more flexible way to represent IP addresses and subnet masks.

> Instead of relying on rigid IP classes (A, B, C), CIDR lets you define **any size** of network using a **slash (/)** followed by the number of network bits.

---

## 🔣 CIDR Format

CIDR notation = `IP Address / Prefix Length`

Example:
```
192.168.1.0/24
```
- `192.168.1.0` = Network address
- `/24` = First 24 bits are the **network portion**
- The remaining 8 bits are for **host addresses**

---

## 🔍 Why CIDR Over Classes?

- 🧃 More efficient use of IP addresses
- 🔄 Eliminates waste from unused host bits
- 📦 Enables **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**
- 🚀 Improves Internet routing scalability

> CIDR saved IPv4 from running out of addresses way too early. It's the real MVP 🏆

## 📊 CIDR to Subnet Mask Table

| CIDR | Subnet Mask         | # Hosts         | Use Case                  |
|------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| /8   | 255.0.0.0            | 16,777,214       | Big companies, ISPs        |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0          | 65,534           | Large networks, campuses   |
| /24  | 255.255.255.0        | 254              | Home, small biz networks   |
| /25  | 255.255.255.128      | 126              | VLANs, server segmentation |
| /30  | 255.255.255.252      | 2                | Point-to-point connections |

> ⚠️ Always subtract 2 (network & broadcast addresses)

---

## 🧮 How to Calculate Hosts

Formula:
```
Number of hosts = 2^(32 - prefix length) - 2
```

Example:
- `/24` → 2^8 - 2 = 254
- `/30` → 2^2 - 2 = 2

---

## 🧪 Pro Tip: Recognize the Ranges

- `/32` = Single host (loopback, point-to-point)
- `/31` = Special case for point-to-point links (no broadcast)
- `/0` = Default route (matches all IPs)

---

## 📱 Real-World Analogy

> CIDR is like ordering clothes by exact fit (e.g., waist 32”) instead of Small/Medium/Large. You allocate **just the right amount** of IP space—no more, no less. 🧵

---

## 💎 Hidden Gems (Interview Special)

- CIDR replaced classful IPs post-1993
- It **aggregates routes** in routing tables (e.g., /16 summarizes many /24s)
- Enables **route summarization** and **supernetting**
- Critical in modern BGP and ISP-level routing

---

## 📌 TL;DR Summary

- CIDR = IP + /prefix length (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Flexible, efficient, modern
- Converts to subnet mask and defines # of hosts
- Powers VLSM, route aggregation, and modern IPv4 efficiency

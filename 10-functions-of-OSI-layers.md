## 🧠 Functions of Each Layer

---

### 7️⃣ Application Layer (User → Network Entry Point)

**Purpose:** Interface between user applications and the network.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- Provides **network services to end-users** (e.g., browser, email)
- Supports **application-level protocols**: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS
- **Authentication**, **file transfer**, **email services**
- Acts as the **entry point** for data to go into the network

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Can I access a website or send an email?”*

---

### 6️⃣ Presentation Layer (Translator & Encryptor)

**Purpose:** Ensures that data is in the **correct format** for the recipient.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- **Data translation** (e.g., ASCII ↔ Unicode)
- **Encryption / Decryption** (SSL/TLS)
- **Data compression** (e.g., ZIP, MP4, JPEG)
- Converts machine formats to human-readable and vice versa

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Make sure you can actually open the file someone sends you.”*

---

### 5️⃣ Session Layer (Session Time, Baby)

**Purpose:** Manages **ongoing sessions** between communicating systems.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- **Establishing, maintaining, and terminating** sessions
- Handles **login/logoff procedures**
- Adds **synchronization points** (e.g., save state in video call)
- Allows **checkpointing & recovery** (in case of failure)

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Let’s start a call, stay on it, and end it gracefully.”*

---

### 4️⃣ Transport Layer (Reliable Delivery)

**Purpose:** Provides **end-to-end delivery** with **reliability and flow control**.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- **Segmentation & reassembly** of data
- **Port addressing** (e.g., port 80 for HTTP)
- **Error detection & correction**
- **Flow control** (e.g., sliding window)
- **Connection-oriented** (TCP) or **connectionless** (UDP)

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Make sure the whole message gets there, in order, no duplicates.”*

---

### 3️⃣ Network Layer (Routing & IP Addressing)

**Purpose:** Determines **path selection** and handles **logical addressing**.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- **Routing**: Chooses the best path to destination
- **IP addressing** (e.g., IPv4/IPv6)
- **Packet forwarding** between routers
- Handles **fragmentation & reassembly**

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Send the letter across the internet using the best possible route.”*

---

### 2️⃣ Data Link Layer (Frame the Data)

**Purpose:** Provides **node-to-node delivery** and handles **MAC addressing**.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- **Framing**: Wraps packets into frames
- **MAC Addressing**: Hardware-level source & destination
- **Error detection** via CRC/FCS
- Controls **access to the media** (e.g., CSMA/CD in Ethernet)
- **Switching** decisions in LAN

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Make sure the data moves across the local network correctly.”*

---

### 1️⃣ Physical Layer (The Bit Carrier)

**Purpose:** Transfers **raw bits** over the physical medium.

#### 🔧 Functions:
- **Bit transmission** (1s and 0s)
- Defines **voltages**, **modulation**, **timing**
- **Physical media**: fiber, copper, radio
- Handles **connector types**, **cable standards**, etc.

> 💡 Think of it as: *“Turn this 1 into electricity, light, or radio—and send it down the wire.”*

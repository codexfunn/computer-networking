## 💡 Mind-Bending Facts

- You can **use the Internet without the Web** (e.g., sending emails, using SSH)
- But you **can’t use the Web without the Internet** — it's the platform it rides on.
- The first web page still exists: [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch)
- The WWW was made free to everyone in 1993 (thank you Tim 🙌)

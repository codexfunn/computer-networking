> “The Internet wasn’t born. It **evolved**.”

### 🕰️ 1960s — The Spark 🔥
- **DARPA (US Defense)** creates **ARPANET** (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).
- Goal: Survive nuclear attacks, keep communication between military computers.

### 🌐 1970s — The Protocols Emerge
- **TCP/IP** is born (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)
- Designed by **Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn** — aka “Fathers of the Internet”
- ARPANET switches to TCP/IP in **1983**. This is considered the **birth of the modern internet**.

### 🖥️ 1980s — Internet Grows
- Universities and research centers join.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** is introduced (you can now type google.com instead of 142.250.182.206 😵)

### 🌍 1990 — The Web Arrives
- **Tim Berners-Lee** invents the **World Wide Web** (HTML + HTTP + URL)
- First website: [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch)

### 🔥 1995+ — Dot Com Boom
- Commercial Internet begins. Google, Amazon, Yahoo are born.
- Home computers + dial-up modems = Internet in your living room.

### 📱 2007+ — The Mobile Era
- iPhone + 4G = Internet in your pocket
